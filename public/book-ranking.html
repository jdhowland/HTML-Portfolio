<h3>Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson</h3>
<p>I have read "The Way of Kings" once and I'm using the audiobook version to refresh 
    the events in my mind before I move on to the second book of the series, "Words of Radiance"  </p>
    <h4>Current books in the series</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>The Way of Kings</li>
        <li>Words of Radiance</li>

<h3>The Dark Tower  by Stephen King</h3>
<p>Stephen King's magnum Opus, this series is one of the most fantastic sagas
    I've had the pleasure of reading. It's a rich western fantasy about a man,
    a gunslinger whose only drive is to reach the Dark Tower
    in a world that is "moving on"
    <h4>Books in the series</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>The Gunslinger</li>
        <li>The Drawing of the Three</li>
        <li>The Wastelands</li>
        <li>Wizard and Glass</li>
        <li>Wolves of the Calla</li>
        <li>Song of Susannah</li>
        <li>The Dark Tower</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<h3>Dune by Frank Herbert</h3>
<p>Admittedly, I've only read the first book so far. It's rich in philosophy
    and is closer to a space opera than traditional sci-fi. There are technically 
    several books in the series but only a few were written by Frank Herbet. My 
    intention is to read the first three books in the "Rise of Atreides" saga.
    <h4>Books in the series I plan on reading</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Dune</li>
        <li>Dune Messiah</li>
        <li>Children of Dune</li>
    </ol>
